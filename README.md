# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based survival predictor for Titanic passengers, using scikit-learn and pandas for data processing and model training on the classic Titanic dataset.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive or not, based on their personal details and ticket information. The project covers the complete pipeline: loading the dataset, cleaning it, exploring important patterns, training a robust classifier, and analyzing the results through meaningful visualizations.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the Titanic dataset (from open public source)
- Handles missing values and encodes categorical features for modeling
- Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict survival
- Evaluates the trained model with validation metrics and confusion matrix
- Supports sample passenger predictions with probability outputs
- Visualizes both data distribution and model performance for better understanding

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- time (standard library)
- ipython (for pretty output in notebooks)

Install all dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìù Usage

- The notebook/script walks you through:
    - Loading and preprocessing Titanic passenger data
    - Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
    - Feature encoding & cleanup
    - Model training & validation
    - Visualizing results: feature importance, confusion matrix, survival breakdowns
    - Running predictions for random validation samples
